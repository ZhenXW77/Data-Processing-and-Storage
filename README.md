- How to improve this assignment

A major issue for this assignment is that the instructions are unclear on how our work will be tested. Even though the instruction said to include any setup needed for graders, this opens up the room for ambiguity as different students will have their own methods for testing. As the students pick their methods, they will ask their own questions, which will clutter up the Slack. One way to test students work is to create a testing file that uses the functions that the students created and test the output against a working version. You might have to create different testing files for different languages.
